# PPOL 670 Final Project

Authors: Juan Reyes, Francesco De Luca, Ilya Schneider

The website is available [here]().

A lot of the inspiration for this project came from Brown, Forastieri, Bruno, and Buschmann (2022), linked [here](https://sbrown5x.github.io/Final_Project/). We used the same data, mainly because it was the best individual level data for our purposes, and aimed to use similar methods. The initial goal of this project was to develop models to predict individual level poverty in non-pandemic and non-recession years. Ideally, this project would be generalizable to all non-disaster years. After creating visualizations, we attmpted to create predictive models. First, we made a decision tree, then a random forest, a KNN model, and a LASSO model, all attempting to predict the likelihood of individal poverty.
